  This is a password-less application you can use to update your
  contact information for the LFA. We would like a non-Langara
  email address and mobile phone number (optional)
  to reach you in the unlikely event
  that members are unable to access the employer's email system.
</p>

<p>
  There are 4 steps to the procedure which you should be able to
  complete in less than 10 minutes. You will need access to your
  Langara email, your personal email, and your mobile phone (optional).
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The first step is to click on the "Get started!" button below.
    You will be asked to verify your Langara email address.
  </li>

  <li>
    You will receive a one-time link (good for 1 hour) in your
    Langara email. If you follow the link, you will be shown your
    current non-Langara email address and mobile phone number that
    the LFA has on file for you. If it is up to date, no further
    action is required. Otherwise, update the information and submit
    the form.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you chose to update your non-Langara email address, you will
    receive a one-time link at that email address. Follow that link
    to complete the update.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you chose to update your mobile phone number (optional),
    you will receive
    a text message on your phone. Reply with 1 to complete the update.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  We are currently unable to automatically validate Yahoo! email addresses.
  Please use another email provider if possible. If you absolutely must use
  a Yahoo! email address, send an email from your Yahoo! account with your
  mobile phone number in the subject line to
  verify@langarafaculty.ca and CC: your Langara email address and we
  will update it manually.
